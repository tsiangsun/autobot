(i have a massive stack of receipts in a folder) he did pretty much everything you would do to a v8. subframe connectors; tunnel brace; traction bars; hotchkis front strut tower brace; suspension techniques sway bars; bilstein shocks; lowering springs. entire suspension and wheel wells were sanded down; painted; replaced with energy suspension bushings. steel braided brake lines; rear disc brake conversion. all brakes are new. ive never drove another camaro that handled like this before. you point where you want to go and it does it. very little sway and smooth on the street.#problem was the car had a bad harness and he could never get it run. engine is bore .030 over w/ v8 valve springs for a custom comp cam. he took it out when it didnt run and trashed it he was so mad. i still have the cam card because he had a jet performance ecu made for it. 2400 stall torque converter; built trans w shift kit to handle spray and rear end w/ 3.73 gears. car was originally built for 150 shot of nos to be a fun sleeper car that he could drive to work every day. never put the system on it since it he couldnt figure out the electrical issue. its really just a smooth cruiser that handles great with out spray and should last a really long time. its mechanically a rebuilt car. only thing is the steering rack is still stock and has a slow leak. its the only thing i ever check and top off.#i picked it up when i blew the motor on my race car that i was also using as a daily at the time; paid all the tags; smogged it; got the a/c going. replaced the engine harness and ignition control module. new fuel pump. a lot of the sensors were replaced so almost everything is new and reliable. ive put over 3k miles on it so far and only changed the oil once. put in a nice pioneer head unit; blue tooth; ipod capable; headphone jack; orion front speakers and pioneer back speakers. new 17x9.5 wheels and 255/40/17 tires. i personally spent $4500 so far. my friend had spent well over $10k before that. bottom line i got my s2000 track car running plus a sti daily and little parking where i live to keep it. car would be great for kid but i dont have one of those to keep it for either lol.#im currently running the stock ecu. msd coils; wires; pace setter headers and custom exhaust w/ high flow cat so its all smog legal. i always get asked if i have an ls or lt. i just replaced the egr valve but it was clogged passageways so the car comes w a spare egr; oem coils. has a k&n stock replacement filter. the injectors are brand new. i have a brand new fuel pressure regulator but it doesnt need it so thats in the box. the entire a/c system was replaced and done right. blows as cold as new. car has custom gauges so some of the needles are not perfectly accurate so he added a dual pillar pod with auto meter oil pressure and coolant gauges. they are on a separate switch so they dont have to be lit up at night when your light are on. car does have line locks which are fun. the fans are on a switch too so you can cool off when ever you want. it also has a transcooler installed. my friend said he still has 1000hp axles at his house i might be able to pick up and throw in. i just dont have a truck to get them. drivers door window was converted to power windows; the switch and kit is there for the passenger side if you want to finish it. right now the passenger is standard manual window. new shocks for the rear hatch. new battery.#im sure there is a lot more. you can go through the receipts and drive it to see how it drives. im in no rush to sell or get super low balled on it; i dont need any trades or more cars lol. any questions; feel free to ask. thanks.,3296.54089944
