(my hobby is snowshoeing during snowstorms; and its one of the few vehicles i would confidently take out in the middle of one to drive to a good trail for a couple hour hike in the snow.)  i would keep it if i had the room.#will include bike rack for hitch.  never really used it because i can just roll my bike into the back just by removing the front tire; but you can have the bike rack if youd like.#private sale only.  will add interior photos once i have that cleared out.  very good condition; particularly in the front.  reminds me; all-weather cargo mat included.#the offering price is a cut & paste from kbb for this vehicle in good condition.,3322.945468
