(please see below)#1) the 05-09 mustangs recently had a recall to replace the front end airbags. the car was brought to the dealer days ago for that replacement.#2) these items were purchased and replaced july; 2017 -- adding: performance duralo brake pads and rotors. (the rotors are slotted and grooved to dissipate heat; while also being zinc coated for a non-rust rotor.)#3) knowing that the bores on the caliper brackets usually go bad on mustangs around 100k miles i replaced the brackets (the slides are back to their youthful state and move insanely fast allowing for instantaneous braking power! you are welcome).#4) when manufactured the mustangs are given poor quality harmonic balancers. at 91k miles i replaced the harmonic balancer/dampener with a new performance balancer/dampener.#5) in the process of replacing the balancer i also swapped out the cam/crank shaft sensor (the sensor will measure proper oscillation from the dampener as it rotates).#6) a new heavy-duty serpentine belt was added at 91k miles.#7) the tires were replaced at 86k miles and are in excellent condition.#8) the cabin air filter and intake air filter by k&n are recent replacements at 91k miles.#9) the oil and oil filter has and always will be changed every 3;000 miles. last change was at 91k miles.#10) also; while changing the balancer/dampener i drained the coolent and had that replaced and also drained and replaced the power steering fluid.#there are plenty of other repairs that have taken place. serious buyers only. if you have other questions about the vehicle please e-mail me and i will respond within the same day. if you prefer to speak over the phone e-mail me your number and i will give you a call. thanks and safe driving!,9484.01944969

(i attached pics.) and lastly; the tie rod ends on the right side needs to be changed. it just started making a small noise when fully turned to the right. but; the car includes new moog inner and outer tie rod ends. as seen in the backseat pics. you just need to install them. also minor cosmetic damage#the $3;800 is o.b.o. i already bought a new car so im not interested in trades sorry. i have a clean blue title to the car. i will entertain offers. feel free to ask any questions you might have.,5350.68465701

dependable; sharp looking cars that are fairly quiet and give good gas mileage; i modified this car as follows:#- roush 710 corvette killer kit installed by brenspeed. fuel upgrades; etc. roush 2300 tvs supercharger. intercooled. runs about 10psi. 93 octane.#- carbon fiber driveshaft can handle more hp than this car makes. lighter and safer. on top of that i still installed a bmr driveshaft safety loop. dont really need it with a cf ds; though.#- exedy clutch kit; pressure plate; etc. 5;000 miles on this set up. i wanted to make sure the power would not cause the clutch to slip. not too stiff; maybe 20% more than stock. the orig did not slip; but as insurance i did the upgrade.#-  the nitto drag radials have low miles on them with drift wheels. they are in excellent shape without scratches; etc. also a set of nearly new wheels and tires on pirelli all seasons 245/275s for driving in cooler temps for an additional $1;000#- tokico d-spec adjustable shocks/struts with ford racing p springs. from full soft to full firm. adjustable with hex key chain. 2 sets of ignition keys. set rears to moderately firm and fronts to full soft for drag racing. firm front; moderate firm rear for handling on curves;etc. set to moderately soft for longer trips and ride comfort.#- ford racing front lower control arms with ford racing ball joints.#- bmr watts link with poly ends. this just came out last year from bmr. allows flat handling without the hard ride.#- whiteline rear lower control arms. less flex without a lot of nvh.#- lower control arm relocation brackets. eliminates all wheel hop. makes the tire bite the road surface for both sport driving or drag racing.#- boss 302 oil cooler. preventative maintennance.#- gt 500 axle back exhaust. no drone. excellent sound.#- the car dynos at 590 rwhp; 490 rwtq on 93 octane.#- i turned 11.80s at the dragstrip with the street pirellis. never power shifted. a lot of torque.#- gauge pods with aeroforce interceptor. mechanical boost. oil temperature gauge. the oil temperature gauge is the most important gauge in any engine because high oil temps can alert you to engine issues. oil changed every 2;000 miles with 5-20 mobil one.#- axle and transmission fluids changed with mobil 1.#- orig brakes have more than 1/2 surface left. no pulsating or noises.#- i am sure there are more things im forgetting.#- i have about $15;000 in the car plus the cost of the vehicle.#the car is very fast; quiet. shifts excellent. braking is very good. steering is tight. i do believe there are no rattles or squeaks. excellent gas mileage. needs nothing.,20701.3920011
