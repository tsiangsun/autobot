(i encourage you to read how we have almost fully restored this car before judging it purely on its mileage.)#i probably dont need to tell you; but this is the ultimate northwest car. during the snowiest winter in years; we were driving around with confidence and never slipped once. nothing beats having that confidence of 4wd and the low center of gravity of a subaru in the snow; rain; or ice.#this car is a pleasure to drive! extremely zippy and handles excellently. very comfortable ride - great for road trips. excellent gas mileage on the streets and highway. big gas tank keep stops at the pump to a minimum.#the ll bean has all the bells and whistles you want - full sunroof; auto windows; seat warmers; leather seats; auto lights; wood steering wheel; cruise control; etc etc. its fully loaded.#we added a very nice pioneer stereo that has bluetooth calling installed (and bluetooth media); aux/ipod functions; and a single cd player. its the one upgrade that was really needed and makes this car so much more awesome.#this car has a lot of miles on it but we have poured well over $5k of work into it to make it last another 100k miles and/or 7-8 years without major engine repairs.#new parts: head gaskets; drive belt; timing belt; steering rack; front struts; catalytic convertor; battery; tires (over 35;000 miles left); and more... much of which comes with a warrantee from the reputable green drop garage. all work history is verifiable.#this car is ready to go! basically; almost every 200;000 mile repair that has needed to be done; has been done. this car is going to last a long time with only minor repairs going forward.#the only reason we are selling this car is that we are moving to sunny california and we already have another 4x4 so we dont need this one anymore. we need a small prius.#fact is; youd be hard pressed to find any subaru for sale for under $10;000; period. this one is (almost) fully restored; has all the bells and whistles; has never had any bodywork; has very few scratches/small dents; no rust; clean title; and has just had over $5;000 work of work poured into it by a reputable garage. the majority of the work has been completed in the last year and within the last 5;000 miles. and yes; like any car with 200k miles; it has some wear and tear; but the car is shockingly clean and in amazing shape. everything works. no broken knobs; switches; etc. its just been well-taken care of.#one more thing: it also comes with about $400 left on a limited warrantee that will expire later this year. you may not use it but it does transfer to you with the car.#youre just not going to find an ll bean with the ability to run another 100k with minimal repairs for under 10k... we know at this price this wont last long but we are pricing it low because we need to sell it before we move. so if this is the subi youve been looking for; and youve got the cash; send us an email so we can show it to you and let you drive it around a bit. maybe it will be your safe; reliable and fun car for the next 5-10 years!#-julia and david,6080.60672381
