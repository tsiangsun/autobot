it is over sized for an outback and required a front brace to maintain stability. with the car i would sell it for $400 or listed separately for $450.#the car is listed competitively to sell fast as the new family truck in the background required a hefty initial investment. even with 192;000 miles; this car is in better condition than anything else you will find in this price range. the single detractor for this car is the suspension. the rear upper control arm bushings are shot and can be replaced with relative ease and the struts are old and leaky (rear driver side). youll have to drive it to see and i have the maintance papers to describe the work that could be done but is not necessary in the near future.#call conor at#show contact info#to see the car.#i can meet you somewhere convenient for us both with the car;

(havent needed to add any fluid since mid may).on the drive from utah the vehicle did have a check engine light come on and it was bank 2 running lean. it has been on only once since then so best case it was poor fuel from one of the random gas stations in wyoming; worst case is the front 02 sensor is slowly wearing out. ( i think they are about $50) i have tried to take very detailed pictures of everything so you know exactly what you are coming to look at,5445.22432843
