(pretty much it will pass)#so much tire kickers; i will now make you pay gas if you decide not to purchase it or think about it.#want me to repair something that is wrong with this car before you buy it; i will charge you extra when selling this car to repair whatever is the problem. oh we have to go to a shop so we can have receipts and paperwork if you decide not to buy the car; i will bring you to court to pay half of it cause you agree as an agreement.#ive been having people setting appointments and not coming; ill wont meeting halfway or go directly to your area for any reason; please remember that this car is a great deal for the price. i might consider raising the price since other prius ads are significantly higher priced than mine.#all the information is mostly in this page; including the vin number...,-10030.5133455
