(hardly nothing; you do the math) it was a back and forth work car for me; sat on weekends. (107k total miles as of 08/01/2017; 70;000 were highway miles and the other 36;000 was by my grandma   church; heb and hair salon...lol#car details:#clean blue title; great running condition; a/c cold & heat works ; defrosters good; custom detachable radio w/ cd player. recently put 4 brand new tires (95% tread left). kept oil changes consistent every due date or 5;000 miles (synthetic due to long mileage for work; avg. 75 miles a day). power windows; good brakes; rotors; replaced whole brake system when i purchased due to the car was kept in garage for long period of times; all lights work inside and out. has enormous trunk space. 12v outlet charger.#minor issues:#driver side window does not roll down; just never got it fixed- i know junk yards sell actuators (that is the small motor for those that do not know; inexpensive for part) middle console that you rest your arm on while driving is disconnected. small tears in the above linen.#so this car has done me well; i really did not want to sell; was enjoying the no payments but i had reached my goal and purchased a new car. i am not looking to make a whole lot; i know there is somebody who could use a work ride; a young teenager that needs to get around; felon trying to make it; this is the ideal car. runs good on gas. id put $25 and that would last a week and that is with all the mileage i was putting- 26 miles in the city and 38 miles on the highway. i just want to help someone that is in need.#cell:#show contact info#i dont answer; leave message and i will return your call as soon i am available. texted is always good too.#always willing to show the car. just give me a heads up. thanks.,1828.20970607
