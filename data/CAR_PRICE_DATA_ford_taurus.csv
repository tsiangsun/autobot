(the computer codes found are:  p2270 and p0420)  if you are looking for a vehicle that will get you there; this is it.  it has a roomy interior; very comfortable seats; and the ac gets nice and cold.  the car has been well maintained; with oil changes approx every 3;000 miles.  here are the only issues i know of:  tears in the leather seating in two places; a very minor low-impact dent in the front-passenger fender; the cd changer does not function properly; but probably could be fixed by a knowledgeable person; and; a slow oil drip; as does almost every car this age.  the drip is not even enough to require adding oil between changes.  we simply put lucas stop-leak in at every oil change and that keeps it to a minimum.  if you are mechanical; you can replace the oil-pan gasket for the minor price of the part ($34.19 at pep boys).#this has been a great vehicle for our family; and we would not hesitate to sell it to a friend at our asking price.#note:  the ford taurus has a very high safety/crash rating; and is also rated as one of the most reliable vehicles on the road; with high performance grades.  this was a high-end taurus when new.  edmunds pricing shows:  original factory price $23;890.  current dealer price $3;107.  current private seller price $1;937.  our asking price is $1;750 cash; or best offer.    sold as-is; with no warranties.  if interested; text only to james; at#show contact info#between 8am and 9pm.,2321.25067197
