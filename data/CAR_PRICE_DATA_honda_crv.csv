(the car does come with one key fab)#- a few small rust spots. the worst one is above the rear wheel on the drivers side. (shown in the picture)#- a couple years ago it started to occasionally sputter when driving around 40mph. we took it to the dealer in june of 2016. they couldnt get it to repeat the issue and said that it may be the oxygen sensor; vtec spool valve or catalytic converter. the issue happened frequently this last may and into early june; but for some reason; hasnt happened once in the last 4 weeks.,1807.56004697

( im not positive as i have to find the title )  he probably didnt even put a few hundred miles on it himself. all together hes spent a little over $3000 total on this vehicle and we would just like to recoup enough to pay off what he borrowed for his new car so please dont contact me to low ball me when its got $500 worth of brand new tires ; a good used cam i paid $300 for that you could sell in itself and its got a fairly decent body and interior. you could even throw a new motor in it and still come out on top. it makes me sick what he spent on all together but i couldnt have him spend anything else on anything else that might go wrong,3047.01987799
