(see photos) 2. i had to disconnect the sway bar as it got water in it and kept tripping the check engine light. now the sway bar light flashes but since i was not using it off road it did not matter to me. 3. there was a rip in the drivers seat which i repaired; not the best job but it works (see photo).#please let me know if you have any questions.#i would also be interested in a partial trade for a; sigh; commuter car. i could use something that could get me around town with a bit better gas mileage so if you have a prius that your just not in to give me a call.,14973.5875823
