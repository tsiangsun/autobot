(i encourage you to read how we have almost fully restored this car before judging it purely on its mileage.)#i probably dont need to tell you; but this is the ultimate northwest car. during the snowiest winter in years; we were driving around with confidence and never slipped once. nothing beats having that confidence of 4wd and the low center of gravity of a subaru in the snow; rain; or ice.#this car is a pleasure to drive! extremely zippy and handles excellently. very comfortable ride - great for road trips. excellent gas mileage on the streets and highway. big gas tank keep stops at the pump to a minimum.#the ll bean has all the bells and whistles you want - full sunroof; auto windows; seat warmers; leather seats; auto lights; wood steering wheel; cruise control; etc etc. its fully loaded.#we added a very nice pioneer stereo that has bluetooth calling installed (and bluetooth media); aux/ipod functions; and a single cd player. its the one upgrade that was really needed and makes this car so much more awesome.#this car has a lot of miles on it but we have poured well over $5k of work into it to make it last another 100k miles and/or 7-8 years without major engine repairs.#new parts: head gaskets; drive belt; timing belt; steering rack; front struts; catalytic convertor; battery; tires (over 35;000 miles left); and more... much of which comes with a warrantee from the reputable green drop garage. all work history is verifiable.#this car is ready to go! basically; almost every 200;000 mile repair that has needed to be done; has been done. this car is going to last a long time with only minor repairs going forward.#the only reason we are selling this car is that we are moving to sunny california and we already have another 4x4 so we dont need this one anymore. we need a small prius.#fact is; youd be hard pressed to find any subaru for sale for under $10;000; period. this one is (almost) fully restored; has all the bells and whistles; has never had any bodywork; has very few scratches/small dents; no rust; clean title; and has just had over $5;000 work of work poured into it by a reputable garage. the majority of the work has been completed in the last year and within the last 5;000 miles. and yes; like any car with 200k miles; it has some wear and tear; but the car is shockingly clean and in amazing shape. everything works. no broken knobs; switches; etc. its just been well-taken care of.#one more thing: it also comes with about $400 left on a limited warrantee that will expire later this year. you may not use it but it does transfer to you with the car.#youre just not going to find an ll bean with the ability to run another 100k with minimal repairs for under 10k... we know at this price this wont last long but we are pricing it low because we need to sell it before we move. so if this is the subi youve been looking for; and youve got the cash; send us an email so we can show it to you and let you drive it around a bit. maybe it will be your safe; reliable and fun car for the next 5-10 years!#-julia and david,5648.39746621

(i have video of the engine running from the car it came out of). because it has a later year model ej257; smog will not be an issue with using (oem down-pipe and oem cats). oem vf48 sti standard turbo; newer oem 2016 sti tmic; dw740cc injectors; full and complete aps turbo inlet (purchased new) with original receipts. it is super rare and a discontinued piece and is simply the best turbo inlet you can buy for your subaru. grimmspeed aos (air oil separator) routed neatly and connected to a cusco oil catch can. just in case the aos misses any blow by. ive never had any oil in the actual catch can. the engine is probably the one of the healthiest ej257 sti motors because it doesnt burn a drop of oil. i check my oil every other fill up when getting gas and its always right below the full mark. so ive never had to add or top off oil. (using redline 5w30) or (eneos 5w40) and changed every 3;000 miles. the car has been fully tuned by sean at metro performance and it is now making a conservative 251awhp and 309wfpt at 18psi. i wasnt looking for high power outputs. just simply reliable power for everyday; daily driving that would safely keep the motor strong and healthy. the exterior and interior are in excellent condition. interior looks and smells new and seats are in perfect condition with no rips; tears; or stains. paint is in great shape with no deep scratches or dents. i will include a full parts list down below. if interested; and for more pictures feel free to contact me at anytime. asking $21;000. the price is slightly negotiable.#engine & exhaust modifications#-2013 sti grb ej257 complete engine with motor mounts.#-2013 sti grb vf48#-2016 sti tmic; y-pipe; sti throttle body coupler; and grimmspeed bpv hose.#-jdm 3 fujitsubo divorced high flow catted downpipe (heat wrapped)#-jdm 3 hks super turbo cat-back exhaust#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 aluminum radiator cooling shroud gold finish#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 aluminum radiator cooling shroud gold finish#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 light weight alternator pulley gold finish#-jdm prova unequal length race headers#-jdm sti 1.3 bar radiator cap#-jdm oem forester sti hood scoop#-subtle solutions hood scoop splitter#-aps turbo inlet pipe complete kit with all hoses; clamps; and pieces installed#-aps 65mm cai with k&n air filter#-aps 50/50 bpv#-cusco turbo heatshield#-cusco oil catch can#-deatsch werks dw200 255lph fuel pump with new fuel filter#-deatsch werks dw740cc sidefeed injectors#-cobb ap v3 sub-002 with full pro-tune#-cobb 3port ebcs#-grimmspeed aos#-grimmspeed main crank pulley with alignment tool#-ngk 1 step colder spark plugs#-mishimoto transmission cooler#-optima yellow top group 35 battery#suspension & handling modifications#-jdm cusco autobacs pro coilovers with new gruppe n front upper strut mounts#-jdm zero sports sti 25mm front sway bar  energy bushings & mounts#-jdm sti gdb front titanium strut bar#-jdm sti gdb spec-c 20mm pink rear sway bar#-jdm sti gdb spec-c pink trailing arms with pillow ball bushings#-2007 sti gdb steering rack & cross member assembly#-2007 sti gdb aluminum control arms#-2007 sti gdb aluminum rear lateral links#-kartboy front & rear endlinks#-whiteline steering rack bushing kit#-whiteline rear subframe locking bolts#-whiteline center roll kit#wheels; tires; & brakes#-volk rays ce28n 5x100 18x8 44 new volk valve stems & caps; and new volk centering rings#-jdm sti aluminum black lug nuts#-bridgestone potenza 760sport 245/40/18 (full set)#-dunlop maxxsport 245/40/18 (full set)#-endless racing 6piston front calipers#-endless front brake pads#-endless brake lines#-dixcel front rotors#-2007 subaru wrx 2piston rear calipers#-stop-tech rear slotted/vented rotors#-hawk hps rear ceramic brake pads#-kartboy 2 pot rear big brake adapters#-motul 660 race brake fluid#interior#-jdm forester sti sg9 black alcantara front & rear seats#-jdm forester sti sg9 door cards#-jdm forester sti sg9 door sills#-350mm zero sports sti steering wheel with original box (ultra rare and brand new)#-2007 subaru sti gdb airbag#-2007 oem sti black floor mats (brand new)#-alpine ine-w960 double din touch screen head unit with dvd player; navigation; blue tooth; and mic/speaker#-oem rear privacy cargo cover#exterior#-jdm subaru forester sg5 cross sports complete front bumper and bumper support with optional cross sports full front lip#-jdm subaru forester sg5 cross sports honey comb front grill#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 rear spoiler with brake light & brake light cover#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 hid silver housing headlights#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 rear bumper (rear spats included but not pictured)#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 side skirts  spats#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 black housing tail lights#-oem sti rear badge#-oem subaru yakima snowboard racks with 2 keys#-new windshield#-hella horns painted black#-led headlight bulb upgrade#additional items that are included with sale:#-subaru sti gc8 v6 type-ra 5speed manual transmission with dccd#-matching r160 lsd rear differential#-jdm genome sti boost; oil temp; & water temp gauge with all sensors; and harness#-jdm subaru sti gdb titanium piston shift knob#-jdm forester sti sg9 doors complete with door cards; door moldings; tinted windows; folding power mirrors with mirror gaskets; power switches; and window motors#-2008 subaru forester door moldings#-2008 subaru forester center console  extended arm rest#-2008 subaru forester manual pedal assembly,10062.7712389

(i have video of the engine running from the car it came out of). because it has a later year model ej257; smog will not be an issue with using (oem down-pipe and oem cats). oem vf48 sti standard turbo; newer oem 2016 sti tmic; dw740cc injectors; full and complete aps turbo inlet (purchased new) with original receipts. it is super rare and a discontinued piece and is simply the best turbo inlet you can buy for your subaru. grimmspeed aos (air oil separator) routed neatly and connected to a cusco oil catch can. just in case the aos misses any blow by. ive never had any oil in the actual catch can. the engine is probably the one of the healthiest ej257 sti motors because it doesnt burn a drop of oil. i check my oil every other fill up when getting gas and its always right below the full mark. so ive never had to add or top off oil. (using redline 5w30) or (eneos 5w40) and changed every 3;000 miles. the car has been fully tuned by sean at metro performance and it is now making a conservative 251awhp and 309wfpt at 18psi. i wasnt looking for high power outputs. just simply reliable power for everyday; daily driving that would safely keep the motor strong and healthy. the exterior and interior are in excellent condition. interior looks and smells new and seats are in perfect condition with no rips; tears; or stains. paint is in great shape with no deep scratches or dents. i will include a full parts list down below. if interested; and for more pictures feel free to contact me at anytime. asking $21;000. the price is slightly negotiable.#engine & exhaust modifications#-2013 sti grb ej257 complete engine with motor mounts.#-2013 sti grb vf48#-2016 sti tmic; y-pipe; sti throttle body coupler; and grimmspeed bpv hose.#-jdm 3 fujitsubo divorced high flow catted downpipe (heat wrapped)#-jdm 3 hks super turbo cat-back exhaust#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 aluminum radiator cooling shroud gold finish#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 aluminum radiator cooling shroud gold finish#-jdm beatrush forester sti sg9 light weight alternator pulley gold finish#-jdm prova unequal length race headers#-jdm sti 1.3 bar radiator cap#-jdm oem forester sti hood scoop#-subtle solutions hood scoop splitter#-aps turbo inlet pipe complete kit with all hoses; clamps; and pieces installed#-aps 65mm cai with k&n air filter#-aps 50/50 bpv#-cusco turbo heatshield#-cusco oil catch can#-deatsch werks dw200 255lph fuel pump with new fuel filter#-deatsch werks dw740cc sidefeed injectors#-cobb ap v3 sub-002 with full pro-tune#-cobb 3port ebcs#-grimmspeed aos#-grimmspeed main crank pulley with alignment tool#-ngk 1 step colder spark plugs#-mishimoto transmission cooler#-optima yellow top group 35 battery#suspension & handling modifications#-jdm cusco autobacs pro coilovers with new gruppe n front upper strut mounts#-jdm zero sports sti 25mm front sway bar  energy bushings & mounts#-jdm sti gdb front titanium strut bar#-jdm sti gdb spec-c 20mm pink rear sway bar#-jdm sti gdb spec-c pink trailing arms with pillow ball bushings#-2007 sti gdb steering rack & cross member assembly#-2007 sti gdb aluminum control arms#-2007 sti gdb aluminum rear lateral links#-kartboy front & rear endlinks#-whiteline steering rack bushing kit#-whiteline rear subframe locking bolts#-whiteline center roll kit#wheels; tires; & brakes#-volk rays ce28n 5x100 18x8 44 new volk valve stems & caps; and new volk centering rings#-jdm sti aluminum black lug nuts#-bridgestone potenza 760sport 245/40/18 (full set)#-dunlop maxxsport 245/40/18 (full set)#-endless racing 6piston front calipers#-endless front brake pads#-endless brake lines#-dixcel front rotors#-2007 subaru wrx 2piston rear calipers#-stop-tech rear slotted/vented rotors#-hawk hps rear ceramic brake pads#-kartboy 2 pot rear big brake adapters#-motul 660 race brake fluid#interior#-jdm forester sti sg9 black alcantara front & rear seats#-jdm forester sti sg9 door cards#-jdm forester sti sg9 door sills#-350mm zero sports sti steering wheel with original box (ultra rare and brand new)#-2007 subaru sti gdb airbag#-2007 oem sti black floor mats (brand new)#-alpine ine-w960 double din touch screen head unit with dvd player; navigation; blue tooth; and mic/speaker#-oem rear privacy cargo cover#exterior#-jdm subaru forester sg5 cross sports complete front bumper and bumper support with optional cross sports full front lip#-jdm subaru forester sg5 cross sports honey comb front grill#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 rear spoiler with brake light & brake light cover#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 hid silver housing headlights#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 rear bumper (rear spats included but not pictured)#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 side skirts  spats#-jdm subaru forester sti sg9 black housing tail lights#-oem sti rear badge#-oem subaru yakima snowboard racks with 2 keys#-new windshield#-hella horns painted black#-led headlight bulb upgrade#additional items that are included with sale:#-subaru sti gc8 v6 type-ra 5speed manual transmission with dccd#-matching r160 lsd rear differential#-jdm genome sti boost; oil temp; & water temp gauge with all sensors; and harness#-jdm subaru sti gdb titanium piston shift knob#-jdm forester sti sg9 doors complete with door cards; door moldings; tinted windows; folding power mirrors with mirror gaskets; power switches; and window motors#-2008 subaru forester door moldings#-2008 subaru forester center console  extended arm rest#-2008 subaru forester manual pedal assembly,11214.1264268
