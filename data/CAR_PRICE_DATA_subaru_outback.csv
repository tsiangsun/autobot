it is over sized for an outback and required a front brace to maintain stability. with the car i would sell it for $400 or listed separately for $450.#the car is listed competitively to sell fast as the new family truck in the background required a hefty initial investment. even with 192;000 miles; this car is in better condition than anything else you will find in this price range. the single detractor for this car is the suspension. the rear upper control arm bushings are shot and can be replaced with relative ease and the struts are old and leaky (rear driver side). youll have to drive it to see and i have the maintance papers to describe the work that could be done but is not necessary in the near future.#call conor at#show contact info#to see the car.#i can meet you somewhere convenient for us both with the car;

(havent needed to add any fluid since mid may).on the drive from utah the vehicle did have a check engine light come on and it was bank 2 running lean. it has been on only once since then so best case it was poor fuel from one of the random gas stations in wyoming; worst case is the front 02 sensor is slowly wearing out. ( i think they are about $50) i have tried to take very detailed pictures of everything so you know exactly what you are coming to look at,6198.54747637

strange but it is just something that happens due to rocks or debris on road thst bounces off underside of vehicles during daily driving . the car has never failed me not once it has gone back and forth to los angeles and lake forest a handful of times and is a very strong running vehicle ! it has never overheated nor has it become hotter than normal driving temp even on hot dsys ! the transmission is strong as well no issues ever with slow or slip shifting ! i have maintained this vehicle very very well always using pennzoil and the appropriate additives for both trans and engine as well as power stearing just to keep it all working well and keeping it lubed and tuned daily!! the tires are at half life and show no signs of irregular wear and tear they are uniform and in good shape ! the interior is a 7-7 1/2 out of 10 ans the exterior is a 7 out of 10! the car runs and drives like it should no issues or hesitation ever!! passed smog last may no problem and is current on registration and insurance! this is a very dependable vehicle and safe . never had any accidents and actually doesnt have bad style even with its age! cloth interior no rips or tears or stains minus the paint spill! front driverside fender has small dent but overall very clean straight body! this car will last another 10-15 years if maintained the way i have done with no major issues as the gasket problem has already been addressed! daily driver for anybody and gas milage is better than average and still has plenty of get up and go!! anything i havent mentioned feel free to ask or come take a look and drive for yourself! its not something amazing but it is a great car!! i am selling it so i can catch up on rent and bills as i hsve been out of work for 2 years now due to injury to my lower back and leg. i also cant afford to insure 2 vehicles and gas when im not working still! if i didnt use my truck so much i would sell it and keep the car but i need my little truck more than the car so here it is! i can honestly say im a truck guy and never hsve owned a small car like this before but i am so impressed with this subaru that i would purchase another one no question!! these are safe dependable cars and i would let my son drive one without any worry these are one of the best vehicles i have ever owned!!!,1677.84052922
