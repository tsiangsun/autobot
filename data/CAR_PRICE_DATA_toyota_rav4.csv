 have you driven all over only to see one turd after another? have you dealt with people who will lie to your face in order to pawn their heap of junk on you in exchange for your hard earned money?  if youre searching for a gently used suv that is reliable; clean and maintained; this may be it.  im interested in making a simple and honest deal with a prospective buyer for our rav4.   this rav4 is a one owner vehicle with extremely low miles for its age.  its a pet free; non-smoking; adult-female owned vehicle.  the car has always had scheduled maintenance with a stack of receipts to prove it.  the car was mostly used to travel back and forth to work locally and occasionally driven on the freeway.  therefore; it doesnt have the typical stone chips and abuse most cars of this age would have.  the paint finish shows about as close to new as any car a third of its age.  its never been in an accident.  the interior was well kept and is free from any rips; tears; or stains.  even though it isnt a luxury bentley or exotic ferrari; it still spent its life parked in the garage and has always been pampered.  as a professional detailer for over 20 years; yes; this is what happens to our daily drivers.#overall; the car runs perfect and has never given us any problems.  we just had it in for its 60k mile service.  the fact that this 4 cylinder rav has a timing chain instead of a timing belt; the dealership informed us that it does not need to be replaced.  that is added good news for the next owner.  it was recommended that we replace the struts; however; were leaving that to the new owner.  otherwise; this dependable; turn-key toyota is ready for its next owner.  the a/c blows cold and the heater works great along with all the other power options.#as for recent maintenance:#battery replaced - april 2017#front and rear brakes replaced - may 2017#front and rear brake rotors machined  - may 2017#4 new tires @ 47;155#oil change performed on june 2017#dmv registration paid on february 2017#now for the specs:#key-less entry#power tilt/sliding sunroof#luggage rack#rear center armrest/cup-holder#mp3 player#blue-tooth connectivity#jbl upgraded premium stereo/speakers#jbl upgraded premium sub-woofer#am/fm w/ in-dash cd player#cruise control#power steering#power door locks#power windows#power sunroof#added features:#tinted windows#2 inch hitch receiver#the biggest plus about the rav4 is its 60/40 split-reclining rear seats.  either a single portion of the rear seat or both portions of the rear seat can be completely folded down for transporting larger items.  the rear center armrest and cupholder is a nice added feature as well. the other desirable feature is its side-hinged rear door.  this was a rare feature in a mid-sized suv and proved to be convenient.  the dilemma with most upward lift-style rear doors; is the clearance issue inside the garage.  its likely to interfere with the garage opening and closing. another plus is the abundance of storage.  as seen in the pictures; there is a ton of storage in the rear cargo area.  there are two hidden compartments under the rear cargo mat.  this is due to the spare tire being attached on the outside of the rear door.  also; there are two glove boxes directly in front of the front passenger seat and plenty of storage in each door panel.  lastly; the front center armrest includes two top/bottom compartments.#this well kept toyota is the perfect car for a first time driver; college student; uber driver or even elderly person.  reason being; its great on fuel consumption (24/30).#ive compared prices of other rav4s with similar options and mine is priced to sell fast.  ive seen others with double the mileage within a range of $11k - $14k.  im fairly priced and i can assure you that you will not find another toyota in this condition; with low mileage and list of receipts for recent repairs and maintenance.  every used car weve sold in the past; has sold to the first person to come out and see it.  we have pride in ownership and its present in this toyota.#the car is being sold as-is with no warranty included.  im a private party seller and will only accept cash; cashiers check; or wire transfer (subject to bank waiting period).#please have your finances in order or necessary permission from your spouse before contacting me.#the car can be shown in either irvine or aliso viejo.  please text with questions or to schedule an appointment to inspect the car.#no 3rd party assistance needed.  no scams!#thank you.#ignore tag words:  pristine condition; meticulous; meticulously; pampered; rav 4; rav; rav4; suv; suv; hatch back; four door; gas mileage; low miles; low mileage; 2013;  2012; 2011; 2010; 2009; 2008; 2007; 2006; 10; 09; 08; 07; 06;,11062.195212
