(see cons)#interior 9/10#exterior 7.8/10#pros:#-new motor/turbo with paperwork roughly 35k miles ago#-new cylinder head and gasket with upgraded oil pump/switch (about 6k miles ago)#-ac blows ice cold; had freon replaced less than a year ago#-all new suspension components less than a year ago with receipts#-new tires less than a few thousand miles on them w/ alignment#-replaced all the old cracked and split pcv hoses (last week) that are notorious for cracking and causing a boost leak.#-moon roof#-one of the few you can actually hear the turbo and blow off valve#-all windows; locks; doors; alarms work#-heated front seats#-22/30mpg#the car has been well taken care of.#cons:#-tip tonic shifting does not work all the time (its not a race car anyways) just needs the piece below the center console replaced but shifts just fine in automatic mode.#-small dent on trunk lid from being backed into from another car.#-hose that comes off of air box (filter) has to be replaced or re glued (see pictures) because our old epoxy job is not holding up in the heat of summer (happens every year its been cracked since i bought it) and causes a check engine light on for code p0171 ( unmetered air past maf) the code will turn off once its fixed we have had this code come on 3 times in the past and it is always that small hose that wants to fall off. i dont want to mess with this car anymore so ill leave it to the buyer to fix this issue so i dont need to put more money/time into the car. even with the small crack the car runs and drives perfect but unfortunately causes the code.#ill bring a scan tool to prove that is the only issue causing the engine light to be on#asking $3;300 obo we are motivated to sell it and need the space so we will accept any reasonable offer.#contact: jordan#show contact info#call or text is preferred; if no answer then please leave a message ill get right back to you.,2711.50006893
